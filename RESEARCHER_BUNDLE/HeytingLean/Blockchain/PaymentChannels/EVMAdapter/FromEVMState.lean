# Blockchain.PaymentChannels.EVMAdapter.FromEVMState

Thin integration seam between an (eventual) EVM semantics and the PCN geometry layer.

At this stage we only fix:
- the vertex type for extracted graphs (`Address := String`); and
- an abstract extractor `EVMState → ChannelGraph Address`.

No concrete EVM operational semantics is assumed here.
